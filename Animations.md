# Transforms
* takes in one or more CSS transform functions as its values, functions take angle or number as values
* EXCEPTIONS (col colgroup and non-replaces elements ~span, b, em~)
## Two dimensional transforms
* rotate(45deg) or: -1 rad, 0.3turn
* scale(0.25, 1.5) scaleX(0.25) scaleY(1.5)
* skewX() skewY() skew() : deg, rad
* translateX/Y :px, %

## Three-dimensional transform
* rotate scale translate to work in 3D you have to use perspective()
* perspective() - sets the distance from the user to the z =0 plane
* eg. transform: perspective(100px) translateZ(30px);
* matrix() - combine all transform functions into one **rarely used**

## Benefits of transforms
* occurs during COMPOSITION : cheaper to use compared to other properties
* can be hardwawre-accelerated via a GPU

* sets the value of the perspective property. Remember, this value sets the distance from the objectâ€™s plane, so the smaller the value is, the more noticeable the perspective effect will be.
The other two sliders refer to the perspective-origin property.
* sets the origin on the vertical axis, from top to bottom, and the bottom slider sets the origin on the horizontal axis, from right to left.

# Transitions
* transition-property - This determines what CSS property will be transitioned. In this case it is the background-color.
* transition-duration - This determines the duration that the transition will occur over. In this case the color change will gradually happen over 1 second.
* transition-timing-function - This lets us change the speed of the transition over the course of its duration. Here it will ease-out, meaning the color change will be faster at the start than at the end of the transition.
* transition-delay - This determines the delay at which the transition will start. In this case, the color change starts a quarter of a second after the cursor rests on the button.

## Performance
* stacking context
* keep animations to only affecting opacity and transform
